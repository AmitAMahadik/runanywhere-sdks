# Swift Transformers Integration Plan

## Overview
Integrate Swift Transformers package into RunAnywhereAI iOS app, moving it from deferred to core services.

## Implementation Status ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Analyzed Swift-Chat example app and Swift Transformers package
2. ✅ Moved SwiftTransformersService from Deferred to Core
3. ✅ Confirmed Swift Transformers package dependency already exists
4. ✅ Implemented proper model loading using LanguageModel class
5. ✅ Implemented text generation with streaming support
6. ✅ Added Swift Transformers models to ModelURLRegistry
7. ✅ Updated getAllModels and updateModelsCollection methods
8. ✅ Confirmed service registration in DependencyContainer

## Analysis Summary

### Swift-Chat Example Analysis
- Uses `LanguageModel` class from Swift Transformers
- Loads compiled CoreML models (.mlmodel or .mlmodelc)
- Uses `GenerationConfig` for generation parameters
- Implements streaming generation with callbacks
- Model compilation happens via `MLModel.compileModel()`

### Swift Transformers Package Structure
- Main modules: `Models`, `Generation`, `Tokenizers`, `Hub`
- `LanguageModel` class wraps MLModel with generation capabilities
- Supports streaming and batch generation
- Built on CoreML with MLShapedArray for tensor operations
- Requires iOS 16+ / macOS 13+

### Compatible Models
- GPT-2 variants (150MB and 646MB versions available)
- Models must be in CoreML format (.mlmodel or .mlpackage)
- Fixed context lengths (256 or 512 tokens for GPT-2)
- Requires corresponding tokenizer files

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Add Swift Transformers Dependency
1. Add Swift Transformers package to iOS example app via SPM
2. Update minimum iOS version to 16.0 if needed
3. Verify package integration builds successfully

### Phase 2: Move and Update SwiftTransformersService
1. Move SwiftTransformersService.swift from Deferred/ to Core/
2. Remove placeholder implementations
3. Import Swift Transformers modules (Models, Generation, Tokenizers)
4. Update service to use actual Swift Transformers APIs

### Phase 3: Implement Model Loading
1. Create model loader that handles:
   - CoreML model compilation (.mlmodel → .mlmodelc)
   - Model caching in application support directory
   - Tokenizer file management
2. Implement proper error handling for missing files

### Phase 4: Implement Generation Methods
1. Update `initialize()` to:
   - Load LanguageModel using Swift Transformers
   - Initialize tokenizer from model config
   - Configure compute units (Neural Engine preferred)
2. Update `generate()` to:
   - Use tokenizer to encode prompt
   - Call model.generate() with GenerationConfig
   - Decode output tokens to string
3. Update `streamGenerate()` to:
   - Implement proper streaming with callbacks
   - Handle token-by-token generation

### Phase 5: Add Model URLs to Registry
1. Add GPT-2 models to ModelURLRegistry:
   - gpt2-base (150MB) - for quick testing
   - gpt2-512 (646MB) - for longer contexts
2. Include model metadata (size, quantization, context length)
3. Add download URL validation

### Phase 6: Update UI Integration
1. Ensure SwiftTransformersService appears in available services
2. Test model download and initialization flow
3. Verify generation works in chat interface
4. Add proper loading states and error handling

### Phase 7: Testing and Polish
1. Test on device with different compute units
2. Verify memory usage is acceptable
3. Test edge cases (empty prompts, max tokens)
4. Add performance monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### Model Storage
- Models stored in: `Library/Application Support/Models/SwiftTransformers/`
- Compiled models cached to avoid recompilation
- Support both .mlmodel and .mlpackage formats

### Error Handling
- Model not found errors
- Compilation failures
- Tokenizer missing errors
- Memory pressure handling

### Performance Optimization
- Use Neural Engine when available
- Implement model quantization support
- Cache compiled models
- Optimize for streaming latency

## Implementation Details

### SwiftTransformersService Implementation
- Clean, modular implementation leveraging Swift Transformers' LanguageModel class
- Reuses existing model compilation logic from CoreMLService
- Proper async/await implementation for model loading and generation
- Streaming support with token-by-token callback
- Neural Engine detection for optimal performance

### Models Added to Registry
1. **GPT-2 Base (150MB)** - 256 token context, Float16 quantization
2. **GPT-2 Extended (646MB)** - 512 token context, Float16 quantization
3. **DistilGPT2 (81MB)** - Smaller, faster variant with mlpackage format

### Key Features Implemented
- Model compilation handling (.mlmodel → .mlmodelc)
- Compute unit configuration (Neural Engine, GPU, CPU)
- Generation config mapping from our options to Swift Transformers
- Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Model size calculation for UI display

## Testing Instructions

1. **Launch the app** and navigate to the models view
2. **Select Swift Transformers** framework
3. **Download GPT-2 model** (150MB for quick testing)
4. **Load the model** and wait for initialization
5. **Test generation** with various prompts
6. **Verify streaming** works properly with token output

## Success Criteria ✅
1. ✅ Swift Transformers service appears in available services
2. ✅ Model URLs properly configured in registry
3. ✅ Service can load CoreML models via LanguageModel
4. ✅ Text generation implemented with proper config
5. ✅ Streaming generation with incremental output

## Known Limitations
- Requires iOS 16+ due to Swift Transformers minimum version
- Models must be in CoreML format (.mlmodel or .mlpackage)
- Fixed context lengths (256 or 512 tokens for GPT-2)
- No batch generation yet (processed sequentially)

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more model architectures (BERT, T5, etc.)
- Model conversion utilities from Hugging Face
- Batch generation when Swift Transformers adds support
- Attention visualization capabilities
- Custom tokenizer support
