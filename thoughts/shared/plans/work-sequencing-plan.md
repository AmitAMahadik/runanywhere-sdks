# Work Sequencing Plan for RunAnywhere SDK Integration

## Executive Summary

This plan sequences the SDK package integrations to minimize conflicts and maximize parallel work between two developers.

**Completed Work:**
- Structured Output Implementation ✅
- Quiz Feature ✅
- GRDB Swift Integration (Phase 1A completed by you)

**Remaining Work:** 6 package integrations
**Total Time:** ~6-8 weeks with smart parallelization
**Critical Path:** Infrastructure → Core Features → Enhancements

---

## Remaining Package Integrations

### Infrastructure (High Priority)
1. **GRDB Swift** - In progress by you
2. **Moya & Swinject** - Dependency injection and networking
3. **DeviceKit** - Device detection replacement

### Enhancements (Medium Priority)
4. **Pulse** - Logging and monitoring replacement
5. **SigmaSwiftStatistics** - Statistical calculations
6. **Aptabase** - Privacy-first analytics

---

## Developer Work Assignment

### Developer 1 (You - Already on GRDB)
**Focus:** Complete GRDB, then monitoring/analytics

### Developer 2 (Cofounder)
**Focus:** Infrastructure modernization (DI/Networking/Device)

---

## Week 1-2: Critical Infrastructure

### Developer 1 (You)
**Complete GRDB Integration (Week 1)**
- Phase 1B-1F: Complete all remaining phases
- Fix database corruption issues
- Files touched:
  - `Data/Storage/Database/*`
  - `Data/Repositories/*`

- Modernize networking layer
- Files touched:
  - `Foundation/DependencyInjection/*`
  - `Data/Network/API/*`
  - New `Assembly/` directory
  - `ServiceContainer.swift` (DI sections)

**Merge Points:**
- Daily sync on ServiceContainer changes
- Clear section boundaries in ServiceContainer

---

## Week 3-4: Device & Analytics

### Developer 1 (You)
**Start Pulse Integration (Week 2-3)**
- Replace logging infrastructure
- Add network monitoring
- Files touched:
  - `Foundation/Logging/*`

- Replace hardcoded device detection
- Fix M3/M4 processor detection
- Files touched:
  - `Foundation/Device/*`
  - `Capabilities/ModelLoading/Services/HardwareDetectionService.swift`

**Conflict Points:**
- Minimal - different subsystems
- Pulse touches monitoring, DeviceKit touches device detection

---

## Week 5-6: Statistical & Analytics

### Developer 1 (You)
**Complete Pulse Integration (Week 4)**
- Finish monitoring setup
- Debug UI integration

**Start Aptabase Integration (Week 5-6)**
- Privacy-first analytics replacement
- Telemetry system migration
- Files touched:
  - `Capabilities/Telemetry/*`
  - `Data/Repositories/TelemetryRepository*`
  - Analytics configuration

### Developer 2
**Complete DeviceKit (Week 4)**
- Finish device detection
- Test on all platforms

**Implement SigmaSwiftStatistics (Week 5-6)**
- Replace custom statistics
- Enhance A/B testing
- Files touched:
  - `Capabilities/ABTesting/*`
  - `Capabilities/PerformanceAnalytics/*`
  - Statistical calculations

**Merge Strategy:**
- Aptabase and GRDB both touch data layer
- Coordinate repository changes
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

---

## Week 7-8: Final Integration & Cleanup

### Both Developers
**Week 7: Integration Testing**
- Cross-test all integrations
- Performance benchmarking
- Fix any integration issues
- Update documentation

**Week 8: Legacy Code Removal**
- Remove ~3,000 lines of replaced code
- Update all imports and dependencies
- Final cleanup and optimization
- Prepare for production rollout

---

## Merge Conflict Prevention Strategies

### 1. Daily Sync Points
- Morning: Review planned changes
- Evening: Share WIP commits
- Use feature branches consistently

### 2. File Ownership Rules
- **ServiceContainer.swift**: Create sections, merge carefully
- **Package.swift**: Alphabetize dependencies, merge frequently
- **Database Layer**: Dev 1 owns during GRDB work
- **Network Layer**: Dev 2 owns during Moya work

### 3. Code Organization
```
// ServiceContainer.swift structure
// MARK: - GRDB Services (Dev 1)
// ... GRDB related services ...

// MARK: - Swinject Migration (Dev 2)
// ... Swinject assemblies ...

// MARK: - Device Services (Dev 1)
// ... DeviceKit related ...

// MARK: - Network Services (Dev 2)
// ... Moya providers ...
```

### 4. Git Strategy
- Feature branches: `feature/grdb-integration`, `feature/moya-swinject`
- Daily rebases from main
- Small, focused commits
- PR reviews before merging

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Merge Points
1. **Week 3**: ServiceContainer major refactor
   - Solution: Pair program the merge

2. **Week 8**: Data layer convergence (GRDB + Aptabase)
   - Solution: Dev 1 reviews all data layer changes

3. **Week 5-6**: Monitoring service overlap
   - Solution: Clear module boundaries defined upfront

### Dependency Risks
1. **Quiz → Structured Output**: Cannot start quiz until structured output ready
   - Mitigation: Dev 1 prioritizes structured output core

2. **Aptabase → GRDB**: Needs stable database layer
   - Mitigation: GRDB completion in Week 3 gives buffer

---

## Conflict Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **ServiceContainer.swift** (Week 1-2)
   - Both devs modify for DI and database
   - Solution: Define clear sections, daily merges

2. **Data Layer** (Week 5-6)
   - GRDB (you) and Aptabase (you) overlap
   - Solution: Complete GRDB first, then adapt Aptabase

3. **Monitoring Services** (Week 2-4)
   - Pulse (you) and DeviceKit (cofounder)
   - Solution: Clear boundaries - logging vs device

### Low-Risk Areas
- Statistics implementation (isolated)
- Device detection (separate module)
- Network layer (after Moya complete)

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily
- Morning stand-up (15 min)
- Evening code review (30 min)

### Weekly
- Monday: Week planning and conflict identification
- Friday: Integration testing and merge

### Conflict Resolution
1. Identify overlap in morning sync
2. Assign primary owner for conflicted files
3. Secondary developer reviews changes
4. Pair program complex merges

---

## Recommended Tools

### For Collaboration
- **GitHub Projects**: Track plan progress
- **Draft PRs**: Early visibility into changes
- **VS Code Live Share**: Pair programming
- **Tuple**: Screen sharing for complex merges

### For Conflict Prevention
- **pre-commit hooks**: Enforce code style
- **SwiftLint**: Consistent formatting
- **git-flow**: Clear branching strategy
- **.gitattributes**: Merge strategy per file type
