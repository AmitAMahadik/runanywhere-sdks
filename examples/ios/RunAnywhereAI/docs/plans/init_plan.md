# RunAnywhereAI iOS App - Implementation Gaps and Remaining Work

## üéØ Executive Summary

The RunAnywhereAI iOS sample app has an extensive architecture built with 10+ LLM framework services, but **ALL implementations are currently placeholders/mocks**. The app successfully builds and runs but requires significant work to integrate actual LLM frameworks and their dependencies.

## üìä **CURRENT APP STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **What Works Now**
- App builds and runs successfully
- UI navigation and components work perfectly  
- Mock services demonstrate the intended functionality
- Architecture supports easy framework integration
- Performance monitoring infrastructure in place

### ‚ùå **What Doesn't Work**
- **No actual LLM inference** - all responses are mock generated text
- **No real model loading** - placeholder implementations only
- **No framework-specific features** - unique capabilities not demonstrated
- **No real performance data** - benchmarks use simulated metrics

## üéØ **PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 weeks)**
1. **Add Swift Package Manager dependencies** for MLX, MLC-LLM, ONNX Runtime, TFLite
2. **Implement 2-3 real frameworks first** (Foundation Models, Core ML, MLX) 
3. **Download sample models** for testing and demonstration
4. **Replace mock implementations** with actual inference calls

### **Medium Term (2-4 weeks)**  
1. **Complete remaining framework integrations** (ONNX, ExecuTorch, llama.cpp, etc.)
2. **Add comprehensive model management** with real downloads
3. **Implement proper error handling** for production scenarios
4. **Optimize performance** for real-world usage

### **Long Term (1-2 months)**
1. **Add advanced features** like model conversion, quantization UI
2. **Create comprehensive documentation** and tutorials
3. **Prepare for App Store submission** with optimized builds
4. **Add analytics and user feedback** systems

## üí° **SUCCESS METRICS**

The app will be considered fully functional when:
- [ ] All 10 framework services perform real LLM inference
- [ ] Users can switch between frameworks and see actual differences
- [ ] Sample models work with their respective frameworks  
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show real framework comparison data
- [ ] App runs smoothly on target iOS devices (iPhone 13+ recommended)

**ESTIMATED TOTAL WORK: 3-6 weeks for full implementation**
