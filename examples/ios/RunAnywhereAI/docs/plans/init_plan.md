## üìä **REALISTIC DEPENDENCY STATUS**

### **Current Working Dependencies (5/5 Core Frameworks)**
The app currently has **3 external dependencies successfully added** + 2 built-in Apple frameworks:

```swift
// WORKING DEPENDENCIES - Ready for implementation:

dependencies: [
    // ‚úÖ Working External Dependencies
    .package(url: "https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-swift-package-manager", from: "1.20.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift", from: "0.25.0"), // Working with 0.25.6
    
    // ‚úÖ TensorFlow Lite via CocoaPods
    // pod 'TensorFlowLiteSwift', '~> 2.17.0'
]

// ‚úÖ Built-in Apple Frameworks (No external dependency needed)
// - FoundationModels (iOS 18+)
// - CoreML (built into iOS)
```

### **All Core Dependencies Working**
```swift
// ‚úÖ All 5 core frameworks have working dependencies:
// - ONNX Runtime (SPM)
// - MLX (SPM) 
// - TensorFlow Lite (CocoaPods)
// - Foundation Models (built-in)
// - Core ML (built-in)
```

### **Deferred Dependencies (6 "Coming Soon" frameworks)**

// ‚è∏Ô∏è Priority 2: ExecuTorch - Beta/Preview, not production-ready (July 2025)
// ‚è∏Ô∏è Priority 3: llama.cpp/SpeziLLM - Version conflicts with MLX Examples
// ‚è∏Ô∏è Priority 4: Swift Transformers - Complex dependency conflicts
// ‚è∏Ô∏è Priority 5: PicoLLM - Proprietary SDK, requires license
// ‚è∏Ô∏è Priority 6: TensorFlow Lite Advanced - Future enhancement

// ‚ùå REMOVED - Don't exist
// MLX Vision, MLX Audio repositories don't exist
```

### **Simplified CocoaPods Setup**
```ruby
# Minimal CocoaPods for MVP:
platform :ios, '15.0'

target 'RunAnywhereAI' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'TensorFlowLiteSwift', '~> 2.17.0'
end
```
