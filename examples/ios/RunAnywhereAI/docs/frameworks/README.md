- You need unified memory architecture
- You're comfortable with newer APIs

### Choose ONNX Runtime if:
- You have ONNX models from other platforms
- You need cross-platform compatibility
- You want flexibility in model sources
- You need specific ONNX operators

### Choose TensorFlow Lite if:
- You have TensorFlow models
- You need quantization options
- You want mature, stable framework
- You need Android compatibility

### Choose Swift Transformers if:

| Foundation Models | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° |
| Core ML | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° |
| MLX | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° |
| ONNX Runtime | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° |
| TensorFlow Lite | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö° |
| Swift Transformers | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° |

*‚ö° = Speed (more is faster), ‚≠ê = Efficiency (more is better)*
